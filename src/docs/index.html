            The Unit Conversion tool allows you to convert measurements between a wide range of 
            units. These include various different types of units, such as those of mass, length, 
            and time, and different systems of units within each general type, such as metric 
            units and US customary units.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started, choose a unit type from the "Unit Type: " dropdown menu, and then 
            choose the two desired units from the two dropdowns. Then, enter a measurement in 
            either text box, and the equivalent quantity in terms of the other unit will be displayed 
            in the other text box. You can also adjust certain settings in the settings dropdown, 
            which has a
            <span class="text-nowrap">
                <i class="bi bi-gear-fill"></i> gear icon
            </span>
            on its dropdown toggler.
